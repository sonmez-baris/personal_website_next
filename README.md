## Project Status

In this project, I used Figma for the design process. I will send commits to the project when I have time. [Click here](https://github.com/sonmez-baris/personal_website_vue) to take a look at my repo where I developed the same design I used in this project with Vue.js. When the repo is complete, I will update my [web page](https://www.barissonmez.com.tr) with this repo. You can use it by making changes and citing the source if you want.

## Project Details

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

### Warnings before uses

Before you start using this template in your own project, update the .env.example file to .env and write your own API path. Also, check your data format before print your values. The default json data format for this application like this;

```bash
{
  'status': 'Success',
  'message': 'Success message',
  'data': JSON
}
```

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
